### You'll need a few libraries to get this running


For Windows:
	◦	Setup Script for Windows
	◦	This script uses pip to install the required libraries. Note that on Windows, tkinter is usually included with the standard Python installation, but the script ensures it's available.

For macOS/Linux:
	◦	Setup Script for macOS/Linux
	◦	This script checks if pip3 is available and then installs the tk library. On macOS and Linux, tkinter is a part of the standard library, but the tk library might need to be installed separately.

To use the scripts:
	•	Download the respective script for your operating system.
	•	Run the script:
	◦	On Windows: Double-click the script or run it in the command prompt.
	◦	On macOS/Linux: Make the script executable with chmod +x script_name.sh and then run it with ./script_name.sh.
