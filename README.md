calculate the amount of times the sun has revolved around you since you were born


### You'll need a few libraries to get this running


For Windows:
	◦	open powershell and type ``` pip install tkinter```

For macOS/Linux:
	◦	(Setup Script for macOS/Linux)[https://github.com/claudchereji/sunRevolutions/blob/9b64b1c779cf4862470171546504e530429e4d83/requirements]
	◦	This script checks if pip3 is on your machine and then installs the tk library (which is needed for the GUI). On macOS and Linux, tkinter is a part of the standard system, but the tk library might need to be installed on it's own.

To use the scripts:
	•	Download the respective script.
	•	Run the script:
	◦	On macOS/Linux: Make the script executable with ```chmod +x sunRevolutions.py``` and then run it with ```./sunRevolutions.py```
